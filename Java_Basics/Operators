Operators
  Symbols that tells compiler to perform some operations.
  Eg:- sum = a + b; here a and b are operants and + is operator.

 Arthmetic operator (Binary/Unary/Ternary)
     Binary:- it has two operants  ("+", "-", "*", "/", "%")
       Eg:- int sum = a  + b;

     Unary:- it has single unit
        Pre increment :- ++a (value change then use)
        Post increment :- a++ (use then change)
       Eg:- int inc = a  + 1;
            inc++ or inc--


     Ternary Operator:- variable condition ? statement1 : statement2;
        Eg:- boolean larger = (5>3)? 5 : 3;
        String type = (5%2==0) ? "even" : "odd";

 Relational operator
     To find relation between two values
     == to check values are equal.
     != to check values are not equal.
     > to check is first value greater then second
     < to check value is smaller
     >= to check value is greater or equal
     <= to check value is smaller or equal

 Logical operator
     To check logics of program
     && (Logical AND)  statement1 and statement2 both should be true to get output true
     || (Logical OR)  statement1 and statement2 any one is true to get output true
     ! (Logical NOT) it makes true statement false or false statement true

 Bitwise operator

 Assignment operator
     It assign the right value to left.
     =  a = b (value of b is assigned to a)
     += a+=b (b is added to a)
     -= a-=b (b is subtracted to a)
     *= a*=b (b is multiplied to a)
     /= a/=b (b is divided to a)




 - Ternary Operator:-
   variable condition ? statement1 : statement2;
   Eg:- boolean larger = (5>3)? 5 : 3;
        String type = (5%2==0) ? "even" : "odd";


 switch(variable){
     case 1 : //output
              break;
     case 2 : //output
              break;
     case 3 : //output
              break;
     default : //output
   }
