 - Arrays
     List of Elements of same type placed in contiguous memory location.
      OR
     Data Structure that is collection of similar type of data.

     datatype [] variable name =new datatype [size];
     Eg:- int [] arr = new int [5];

     Operations:-
         Create
            datatype [] variable name =new datatype [size];
            Eg:- int [] arr = new int [5];
         Input
            int [] numbers = {1,2,3,4};
            String [] names = {"Anshul", "Rahul", "Ram"}
         Update
            int [] numbers = {1,2,3,4};
            numbers[2] = 5;
         Output

     - Internal Working:-
          int [] arr    -> Declaration of array
                           Array is defined in stack memory in compile time.

          arr = new int [5]  -> Initialization of array
                                 Object is created in heap memory at runtime.


    - It has 0-based indexing.
    - Default value eof array is 0 or null.
    - Values of array is itself an object and stored in different parts of heap.
    - It is mutable that is it can change object.
      (If two variable points to an object, if one changes another will affected).


    Advantages of Arrays:-
      Random access
      Cache friendliness
